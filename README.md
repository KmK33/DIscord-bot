# Discord Application Bot

Welcome to the Discord Application Bot project! This bot aims to streamline the process of applying for whitelist access on a Discord server. Users can fill out an application directly through a Discord application modal. Their application will then be subject to a voting process where members of the server can vote to accept or reject the application. If the application receives enough votes in favor of acceptance within a specified time frame, the applicant will be granted a certain role determined by the server owner.

## Features

- **Application Submission**: Users can submit applications directly through Discord using a modal interface.
- **Voting System**: Members of the server can vote to accept or reject applications with a simple click.
- **Automated Role Assignment**: Applicants meeting the acceptance criteria receive a specified role automatically after the voting period ends.
- **Customizable Settings**: Server owners can customize various aspects of the bot, including voting time frame and accepted role.
